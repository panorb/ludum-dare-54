	"first_warning": "Hello to our Woolly Wizard,\n\nwe love your carefully constructed cabins, yet we could not help but notice a bothersome predicament:\n\nPlease ensure to make sufficient space for the arriving array of additional sheep. We trust you will accommodate our arrangement.\n\nFriendly greetings,\n\nThe Town Council\nWoolhio, New Yarn",
	"second_warning": "Dear wizard,\n\nwith heavy hearts we heard of herds of homeless, helpless sheep.\n\nWe would advise our woolly wizard to take it up a notch - all the way up, in fact.\n\nConsider this consultation carefully, as our cooperation could conclude if worse comes to worst.\n\nWith a warning word to the wise,\n\nThe Town Council\nWoolhio, New Yarn",
	"third_warning": "With woeful warning words to our woolly wizard,\n\non our previous papers we put careful consideration into your counseling, yet it seems that our words would not work as motivational messages.\n\nHereby the Woolhio City Council wants to warn you one last time to accommodate more shelter for sheep, as further violations warrant drastic dispossession.\n\nThe Town Council,\nWoolhio, New Yarn",
	"win": "To our city's perfect builder,\n\nyou succeeded in placing plenty, pretty quarters to accommodate all the sheep we can come up with in current circumstances.\n\nWe thank you heartily for your enormous efforts, and congratulate you on coming this far.\n\nThere's no need for additional domiciles, but nothing is stopping you from exploring the limits and expanding linearly.\n\nWith congratulatory greetings,\n\nThe Town Council\nWoolhio, New Yarn",
	"good_ending": "To the Woolly Wizard that wrapped up the impossible,\n\nit is time to conclude the complex condo, as you have indeed approached the limits of all things possible.\n\nWe thank you for the time and effort invested into this beautiful building, and invite you to come back and try again at any time.\n\nYour building has surpassed a staggering [b]%d[/b] stories, unmatched for any of its kind.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Town Council\nWoolhio, New Yarn",
	"game_over": "To our traveling troublemaker,\n\nEVICTION NOTICE\n\nIt seems like you could not satisfy the quality standards that our [s]livestock[/s] precious sheep require for optimal wool growth and population expansion.\n\nYour measly [b]%d[/b] story building is dwarfed by structures like our Shears-Tower, and could only accommodate a total of [b]%d[/b] animals.\n\nWe expected better, and the council has decided to sever it's [s]yarn[/s] ties with you.\n\nThe Town Council\nWoolhio, New Yarn"
